// Content script for Cricket Textual Highlights Grabber
// This script can directly interact with the page DOM if needed
// Currently, the main functionality is handled by popup.js

console.log("Cricket Highlights Grabber content script loaded");

// This script can be expanded later if we need direct page interaction
// rather than using executeScript from the popup
